# Orange Regression Project - Machine Learning

Objectives:
Build a machine learning model with Orange to estimate which variables are correlated to the Debt-GDP ratio.

Disclaimers:
This project, was built to get familiar with the tool and explore the uses of machine learning possibilities. 
There is no intention to present results as truth. To do it a bigger scientific consistency would be needed.
Some of the variables taken into account are part of Debt. There is causality between the variables.
